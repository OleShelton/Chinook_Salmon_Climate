This repo contains the derived data products and estimation code for Shelton et al. 2021 "Redistribution of salmon populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean in response to climate" published in Fish and Fisheries. All of the data provided here have been modified from original sources to contribute to the Stan code that estimates the ocean distribution of fall-run Chinook salmon populations in 17 discrete regions between Alaska and California. Many details can be found in the main text of the manuscript and the five appendices of supplementary material.

The Code folder contains an R script "Run_Salmon_Climate_Stan.R" which reads in needed data and runs the Stan model "Chinook_Salmon_Distribution.stan" which estimates ocean distribution for Chinook salmon stocks and many other quantities.

The Data folder contains derived data products that are used in "Run_Salmon_Climate_Stan.R" but could also be potentially used for other purposes if desired.  There is a detailed "_ReadMe_Data" in that folder to describe each data set.
